# Overcomer - Your Journal to help with defeating sin.


Hi, I'm Ethan. For my entire life just like you I've struggled with sinning. It didn't matter whether it was lust, anger, envy, or greed. I just wasn't the best person I could've been.
One night, I had thought to myself, all of these people struggle with sinning on a daily basis and don't really have a way to fight it. So, I made Overcomer. 
Below, you can read the features. I hope your journey is easy, but it may not be. God is with you during the entirity of it


## Features:
Journey Tracker; Track how long its been & sin you are overcoming
Progress Bar; Easily see a progress bar.
Verse of the Day; Unfortunately, I'm a busy person therefore, I can't update this code everyday. Verse of the Day is more of a random verse but they all relate to strength & sins.
Prayer Journal; This "journal" is a fully encrypted region of the site where you can write any type of prayer to God or confession. I will never see it, it can't be hacked, and you will never see it again. God will see it and he's the only one meant to see it.


## My story:
I've struggled with sinning for a while just like us all and it was messing my mental health & self-esteem up really badly. I could go a few days without sinning and then I was back to my old ways. The sin I've struggled with the most is lust. Lust is the most deadly sin. Lust has taken the strongest men in the Bible down. Lust isn't just having s*xual relations with non-married, it's even looking at a female with lustful intent. Just by looking at her like that, that is adultery. I mainly will use this site to overcome lust but I also struggle with swearing. May we all overcome our sins.


## Quick Prayer:
Heavenly Father, I ask that you help my friend on the other side of this screen overcome what ever sin they are fighting. Let them get close with you, and leave this sin in the dark. They cannot do it without your strength, so God I ask you bless them to overcome their sin. Amen.

## Reminder:
God doesn't ask us to be sinless which is impossible. However, we can sin less. No matter how many times you fall God will pick you up and hold you high.
